## JavaScript interoperability

Trunk will create the necessary JavaScript code to bootstrap and run the WebAssembly based application. It will also
include all JavaScript snippets generated by `wasm-bindgen` for interfacing with JavaScript functionality.

By default, functions exported from Rust, using `wasm-bingen`, can be accessed in the JavaScript code through the global
variable `window.wasmBindings`. This behavior can be disabled, and the name can be customized. For more information
see the [`rust` asset type](@/assets.md#rust).

## Library crate

Aside from having a `main` function, it is also possible to up your project as a `cdylib` project. In order to do that,
add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
```

And then, define the entrypoint in your `lib.rs` like (does not need to be `async`):

```rust
#[wasm_bindgen(start)]
pub async fn run() {}
```
